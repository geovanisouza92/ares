\textit{The modern information systems has been growing in size, incorporating more dynamism and changing significantly through executing to attend the necessity and growing of the organizations that keeping it. Thus, it's needed that these programs have good performance, giving opportunity to incorporate analysis and transformations through their life time.}\\\\
\textit{LLVM's a set of tools to execute analysis and transformations, including intermediate code representation and code generation structure.}\\\\
\textit{This work propose to demonstrate the LLVM's application to construction of a platform independent programming language that enjoy of "multiple steps optimization" strategy propose by the tool.}\\[1.5cm]
